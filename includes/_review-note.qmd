## :teacher: Instructor note

Before beginning, get them to recall what they remember of the previous
session, either with something like Mentimeter, verbally, or using hands 
/ stickies / origami hats. Preferably something that will allow everyone 
to participate, not just the ones who are more comfortable being vocal 
to the whole group.

Depending on what they write, you may need to briefly go over the previous
session.
