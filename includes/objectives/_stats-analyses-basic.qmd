1.  Apply functional programming concepts to run statistical analyses
    that fit within the `{targets}` pipeline framework, regardless of
    what statistical method is used.
2.  Describe the general "workflow": State the research question,
    construct a model, prepare the data, fit the model, and extract the
    results.
3.  Categorize the model definition step as a distinct, theory-driven
    step, separate from the data, and use `{parsnip}` functions to help
    with defining your model.
4.  Identify some data transformation techniques and evaluate which are
    good options given the data. Use functions in the `{recipes}`
    package to apply these transformations to your data.
5.  Use the `{broom}` package to extract the model results to later
    present them in graphical format (with `{ggplot2}`).
