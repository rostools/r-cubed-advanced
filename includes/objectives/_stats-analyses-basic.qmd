This session's **overall learning outcome** is to:

1.  Describe the basic framework underlying most statistical analyses
    and use R to generate statistical results using this framework.

**Specific objectives** are to:

1.  Describe the general "workflow": State the research question,
    construct a model, prepare the data, fit the model, and extract the
    results.
2.  Categorize the model definition step as a distinct, theory-driven
    step, separate from the data, and use `{parsnip}` functions to help
    with defining your model.
3.  Identify some data transformation techniques and evaluate which are
    good options given the data. Use functions in the `{recipes}`
    package to apply these transformations to your data.
4.  Use the `{broom}` package to extract the model results to later
    present them in graphical format (with `{ggplot2}`).
5.  Continue applying the concepts and functions used from the previous
    sessions.

Specific "anti"-objectives on things that we will *not* learn:

-   How to choose and apply the appropriate statistical model or tests.
-   Statistical theory.
-   How to determine relevant data transformations for statistical
    tests.
-   How to interpret the statistical results.

This means that what we show is *for demonstration purposes only*. Our
implementation and choice of model and analyses could be wrong if an
expert were to review them.
