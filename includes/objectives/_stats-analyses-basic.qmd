1.  Design a rough outline of an analysis workflow where data flows
    through multiple functions to produce a desired output.
2.  Apply functional programming concepts to run statistical analyses
    that fit within the `{targets}` pipeline framework, regardless of
    what statistical method is used.
3.  Decompose a complex statistical analysis into smaller functions,
    where each function achieves a part of the larger output so that the
    function can later be used flexibly and scalably with any number of
    inputs.
4.  Use the `{broom}` package to extract the model results in a tidy
    form.
