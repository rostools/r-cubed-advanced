1.  Describe the computational meaning of *pipeline* and how pipelines
    are often used in research.
2.  Explain why a well-designed pipeline can streamline collaboration,
    reduce time spent on an analysis, make the analysis steps explicit
    and easier to work with, and ultimately contribute to more fully
    reproducible research.
3.  Explain the difference between a "function-oriented" workflow and a
    "script-oriented" workflow, and why the function-based approach has
    multiple advantages from a time- and effort-efficiency point of
    view.
4.  Setup an analysis pipeline using `{targets}` that clearly defines
    each step of your analysis---from raw data to finished manuscript---
    that makes updating your analysis by you or your collaborators as
    simple as running a single function.
