1.  Build an analysis pipeline using `{targets}` that clearly defines
    each step of your analysis---from raw data to finished manuscript---
    that makes updating your analysis by you or your collaborators as
    simple as running a single function.
2.  Apply a design-driven approach to building the pipeline step by
    step, to help manage complexity and help you focus on testing and
    building the pipeline at each stage.
3.  Use the principle of "start at the end", but working backwards from
    your desired final outputs to the raw data, to help design, plan,
    and build your pipeline effectively.
