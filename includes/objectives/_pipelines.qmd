1.  Describe the computational meaning of *pipeline* and how pipelines
    are often used in research.
2.  Explain why a well-designed pipeline can streamline collaboration,
    reduce time spent on an analysis, make the analysis steps explicit
    and easier to work with, and ultimately contribute to more fully
    reproducible research.
3.  Explain the difference between a "function-oriented" workflow and a
    "script-oriented" workflow, and why the function-based approach has
    multiple advantages from a time- and effort-efficiency point of
    view.
4.  Build an analysis pipeline using `{targets}` that clearly defines
    each step of your analysis---from raw data to finished manuscript---
    that makes updates by you and your collaborators are as simple as
    running a single function.
