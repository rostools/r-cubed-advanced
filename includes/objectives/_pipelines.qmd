This session's **overall learning outcome** is to:

1.  Apply an approach to build an analysis pipeline that clearly defines
    each step of your analysis---from raw data to finished manuscript---
    so that updates by you and your collaborators are as simple as
    running a single function.

More **specific objectives** are to:

1.  Describe the computational meaning of *pipeline* and how pipelines
    are often used in research. Explain why a well-designed pipeline can
    streamline collaboration, reduce time spent on an analysis, make the
    analysis steps explicit and easier to work with, and ultimately
    contribute to more fully reproducible research.
2.  Explain the difference between a "function-oriented" workflow and a
    "script-oriented" workflow, and why the function-based approach has
    multiple advantages from a time- and effort-efficiency point of
    view.
3.  Use the functions within `{targets}` to apply the concepts of
    building pipelines in your analysis project.
4.  Continue applying the concepts and functions introduced in the
    previous session
