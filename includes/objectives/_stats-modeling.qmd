1.  Identify the basic features of statistical models and how they can
    assist you in structuring your code and analysis.
2.  Explain why you should tightly couple making a research question
    with creating a conceptual regression model that can be used to
    answer that question.
3.  Describe the general "workflow": State the research question,
    construct a model, prepare the data, fit the model, and extract the
    results.
4.  Use the regression model to identify how your data should look like
    and what transformations are needed before you fit the model to the
    data.
