This session's **overall learning outcome** is to:

1.  Identify actions to streamline collaboration on a data analysis
    project and create projects with R that apply many of these actions.

**Specific objectives** are to:

1.  Explain what a "project-oriented" workflow is, what a project-level
    R dependency management is, and why these concepts are important for
    collaborative and reproducible analyses.
2.  Describe the difference between workflow dependencies and build
    dependencies, and apply functions in the `{usethis}` R package to
    implement these dependency management concepts.
3.  Explain how following a style guide helps build a common approach to
    reading and writing R code, and thereby improves project-level
    collaboration.
4.  Use `{styler}` and RStudio's canonical markdown mode to
    programmatically check and apply style guides to your project files.
