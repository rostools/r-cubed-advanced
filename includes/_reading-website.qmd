We try to be consistent with the way to present certain information in
this website. Specifically, we follow some conventions that you should
be aware of:

-   Folder names always end with `/`, for example `data/` means the data
    folder.
-   File names always end with their file extension, for example
    `content.md` means the file is a Markdown file.
-   R variables are always shown as is. For instance, for the code
    `x <- 10`, `x` is a variable because it was assigned with 10.
-   Functions always end with `()`, for instance `mean()` or
    `read_csv()`.
-   Sometimes functions have their package name appended with `::` so
    that you run the code from the specific package, since we likely
    haven't loaded the package with `library()`. For instance, to
    install packages from GitHub using the `{pak}` package we use
    `pak::pak("user/package_name")`. You'll learn about this more later.
