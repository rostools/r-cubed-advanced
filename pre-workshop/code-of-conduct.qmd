# Code of conduct {#sec-code-of-conduct}

Learning happens when we feel safe and supported. Since we want you to
learn during this workshop, we want you to feel safe and supported. We
also want all learners to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience
while participating in this workshop. So we expect all learners to show
respect, kindness, and courtesy to other learners throughout the whole
workshop and to help create a positive and safe learning environment.

While most people and (sub-)cultures have an implicit, assumed set of
practices and expectations for behaviour, we believe strongly in
effective and clear communication. This includes making what is normally
implicit expectations to instead be explicit expectations.

Teachers and helpers will uphold and embody this code in all spaces and
activities of the workshop, and we expect you as the learner to do the
same. In fact, by participating in this workshop, you indicate that you
agree to follow these explicit expectations. We have this code of
conduct to communicate to you that we really value and want to nurture a
space that encourages and enhances learning. Otherwise, why would we
have a workshop if you can't or aren't able to effectively learn
anything from it! :zany_face:

## Expected behavior

We want a welcoming, supportive, safe, and fun environment not only for
ourselves as teachers and helpers, but also for all learners, regardless
of background and identity. This means that we do not tolerate behaviour
that is disrespectful to any of our teachers, helpers, or learners (see
below for unacceptable behaviour).

We encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all interactions
during this workshop that will foster a positive and professional
learning environment:

-   Show kindness, courtesy, and respect towards other workshop members.
-   All interactions should be professional regardless of platform:
    either online or in-person.
-   Be aware of your words by using welcoming and inclusive language.
    Words matter, a lot!
-   Be respectful to different viewpoints and experiences.
-   Gracefully accept constructive criticism.
-   Focus on what is best for everyone in the workshop.

## Unacceptable behavior

While we assume you will not do these behaviours, we want to clearly
communicate what unacceptable behaviour is. It is any behaviour, as
actions or words, that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to
others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on
characteristics that include, though are not limited to, gender identity
and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy,
familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief
(or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age,
education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience
level. We of course also don't tolerate verbally or physically violent
behaviour towards others.

Examples of unacceptable behavior includes:

-   Written or verbal comments that exclude people on the basis of
    membership of any specific group.
-   The display of sexual or violent images.
-   Unwelcome sexual attention, advances, and/or physical contact.
-   Sustained disruption of workshop sessions or communications.
-   Insults or put downs.
-   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary
    jokes.

## Consequences of unacceptable behavior

Learners who are asked, either in person or online, to stop any
inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a learners
engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organizers,
teachers, or helpers may take any action they deem appropriate,
including warning the offender or removing them from the workshop.

If you feel in any way unsafe or mistreated, you may contact us
privately---all communication is confidential.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly workshop for all
