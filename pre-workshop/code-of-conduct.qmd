# Code of conduct {#sec-code-of-conduct}

Science thrives on diversity of thought and origin. We value the
participation of every member of the scientific community and want all
learners to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly,
all learners are expected to show respect and courtesy to other members
throughout the workshop, in group work, and any activity associated with
this workshop.

To make clear what is expected, everyone taking part in this workshop,
including teachers, helpers, organizers, and learners, is required to
conform to the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this
code throughout the workshop, but you may also contact us privately; all
communication will be treated as confidential.

The code of conduct applies to all spaces associated with this workshop
including, but not limited to, group work, emails, and any online forums
like GitHub. By participating, learners indicate their
acceptance of the procedures by which the teachers and organizers
resolves any code of conduct incidents.

## Expected behavior

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for
all people, regardless of background and identity. As such, we do not
tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners or
that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not
tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that
include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship,
nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status,
veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack
thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education,
socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment, we
encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all interactions during
this workshop:

-   Show kindness, courtesy and respect towards other workshop members
-   All interactions should be professional regardless of platform:
    online or in-person
-   Be aware of your words by using welcoming and inclusive language
-   Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
-   Gracefully accept constructive criticism
-   Focus on what is best for the workshop members and the community
    overall

rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for further
recommendations and details on proper behaviour.

## Unacceptable behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by learners include:

-   Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people
    on the basis of membership of any specific group

    following, or intimidation

-   Continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or
    recording) with someone after being asked to stop
-   Publication of private communication without consent

## Consequences of unacceptable behavior

Learners who are asked, either in person or online, to stop any
inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a learners
engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organizers,
teachers, or helpers may take any action they deem appropriate,
including warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop.
