# Code of conduct {#sec-code-of-conduct}

Learning happens when we feel safe and supported. We also want all
learners to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience while
participating in this workshop. So we expect all learners to show
respect, kindness, and courtesy to other learners throughout the whole
workshop.

While most people and (sub-)cultures have an implicit, assumed set of
practices and expectations for behaviour, we believe strongly in
effective and clear communication. This include making what is normally
implicit expectations to instead be explicit.

Teachers and helpers will uphold and embody this code throughout all
spaces and activities of the workshop, and we expect you as the learner
to do the same. In fact, by participating in this workshop, you indicate
that you agree to follow these explicit expectations. We have this code
of conduct to also communicate to you that we really value and want to
nurture a space that encourages and enhances learning. Otherwise, why do
a workshop if you can't learn! :zany:

## Expected behavior

We want a welcoming, supportive, safe, and fun environment not only for
ourselves as teachers and helpers, but also for all learners, regardless
of background and identity. This means that we do not tolerate behaviour
that is disrespectful to any of our teachers, helpers, or learners (see
below).

In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment, we
encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all interactions during
this workshop:

-   Show kindness, courtesy, and respect towards other workshop members
-   All interactions should be professional regardless of platform:
    online or in-person
-   Be aware of your words by using welcoming and inclusive language
-   Be respectful to different viewpoints and experiences
-   Gracefully accept constructive criticism
-   Focus on what is best for everyone in the workshop

## Unacceptable behavior

While we assume you will not do these behaviours, we want to clearly
communicate what unacceptable behaviour is. It is any behaviour, as
actions or words, that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to
others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on
characteristics that include, though are not limited to, gender identity
and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy,
familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief
(or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age,
education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience
level. We of course also don't tolerate verbally or physically violent
behaviour towards others.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by learners include:

-   Written or verbal comments that exclude people on the basis of
    membership of any specific group
-   The display of sexual or violent images
-   Unwelcome sexual attention, advances, physical contact
-   Sustained disruption of workshop sessions or communications
-   Insults or put downs
-   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary
    jokes

## Consequences of unacceptable behavior

Learners who are asked, either in person or online, to stop any
inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a learners
engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organizers,
teachers, or helpers may take any action they deem appropriate,
including warning the offender or removing them from the workshop.

If you feel in any way unsafe or mistreated, you may contact us
privately---all communication is confidential. Thank you for helping
make this a welcoming, friendly workshop for all :smile:
