# Pre-workshop tasks {#sec-pre-workshop}

In order to participate in this workshop, you must complete the
pre-workshop tasks in this section as well as **completing the
[survey](survey.qmd)** at the end. These tasks are designed to make it
easier for everyone to start the workshop with everything ready to go.
For some of the tasks, you might not understand why you need to do them,
but you will likely understand why once the workshop begins.

Depending on your skills and knowledge, these tasks could take between
**5-7 hrs to finish**, so we suggest planning a full day to complete
them. Depending on your institution and how they handle installing
software on work computers, you also might have to contact IT *very
early* to make sure everything is properly installed and set up.

## List of tasks

Here's a quick overview of the tasks you need to do. Specific details
about them are found as you work through this section.

1.  Do some pre-reading to get a better idea of the workshop content
    (@sec-pre-reading).
2.  Read through the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.qmd) (in
    @sec-code-of-conduct).
3.  Install the necessary programs and the right versions of those
    programs in @sec-install-programs. For some people, depending on
    their institution, this task can take the **longest amount of time**
    because you have to contact your IT to install these packages.
4.  Install the necessary R packages in @sec-install-r-packages.
5.  Correctly set up Git on your computer in @sec-setup-git, if you
    haven't done this already from previous workshops. If you haven't
    used Git before, this task could take a while because of the
    reading.
6.  Run a check with `r3::check_setup()` to see if everything works.
    You'll later need to paste this output into the survey.
7.  Connect your computer with GitHub in @sec-connect-github.
8.  Create an R Project in @sec-create-project, along with the folder
    and file setup and creating a Quarto file.
9.  Write (well, mostly copy and paste) R code to download the data and
    save it to your computer. This task will probably take up maybe
    30-60 minutes depending on your interest in exploring the data.
10. Run a check using `r3::check_project_setup_advanced()` to see that
    everything is as expected. You'll later need to paste this output
    into the survey.
11. **Complete the pre-workshop [survey](survey.qmd) (in @sec-survey)**.
    This survey is pretty quick, maybe \~10 minutes.

Check each section for exact details on completing these tasks.

## Learning objective {#sec-pre-workshop-learning-objectives}

In general, these pre-workshop tasks are meant to help prepare you for
the workshop and make sure everything is setup properly so the first
session runs smoothly. However, some of these tasks are meant for
learning as well as for general setup, so we have defined the following
learning objectives for this page:

1.  Learn about and then apply some basic reproducible workflows and
    setups for the initial processing of raw data. For those who have
    already participated in the [intermediate R
    workshop](https://r-cubed-intermediate.rostools.org/), the objective
    is to review what you previously learned.
