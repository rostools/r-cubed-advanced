# Survey {#sec-survey}

We have a [Code of Conduct](/pre-workshop/code-of-conduct.qmd).
If you haven't read it, **read it now**. The survey involves a question
about Conduct. We want to make sure this workshop is a supportive and safe
environment for learning, so this Code of Conduct is quite important.

If you haven't read the sections under "Workshop overview" and
"Pre-workshop tasks", **please read them now**.

You're almost done. Please fill out the pre-workshop survey to finish
this section:

See you at the workshop! :wave:
