# Setting up Git {#sec-setup-git}

Since Git has already been covered in the previous workshops, we won't
cover *learning it* during this workshop. However, since version control
is a fundamental component of any modern data analysis workflow and
*should be used*, we **will be using it throughout the workshop**. If you
have used or currently use Git and GitHub, you can skip these two tasks.
If you **have not used Git or GitHub**, please do these tasks:

1.  Type in the RStudio Console and follow the instructions:

    ``` {.r filename="Console"}
    # There will be a pop-up to type in your name (first and
    # last), as well as your email
    r3::setup_git_config()
    ```

2.  **Please ONLY read** through the [Version Control
    lesson](https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org/sessions/version-control.html)
    of the introduction workshop, **but DO NOT DO any coding tasks or exercises**.
    You are welcome to do them if it will
    help you learn or understand it better, but it is **NOT** required. For most of the workshop, we
    will be using Git as shown in the [Using Git in
    RStudio](https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org/sessions/version-control.html#using-git-in-rstudio)
    section. During the workshop, we will connect our projects to GitHub,
    which is described below.

Regardless of whether you've done the steps above or not, *everyone*
needs to run:

``` {.r filename="Console"}
r3::check_setup()
```

The output you'll get for success will look something like this:

```
Checking R version:
✔ Your R is at the latest version of 4.4.1!
Checking RStudio version:
✔ Your RStudio is at the latest version of 2024.9.0.375!
Checking Git config settings:
✔ Your Git configuration is all setup!
  Git now knows that:
  - Your name is 'Luke W. Johnston'
  - Your email is 'lwjohnst@gmail.com'
```

**Eventually you will need to copy and paste the output into one of the
survey questions**. *Note* that while GitHub is a natural connection to
using Git, given the limited time available, we will only be going over
aspects of GitHub that relate to storing your project Git repository and
working together. If you want to learn more about using GitHub, check
out the
[session](https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org/sessions/version-control.html)
on it in the introduction workshop.

## Connect with GitHub {#sec-connect-github}

Because we'll be pushing and pulling to GitHub throughout the workshop, as
well as using GitHub to collaborate with others in the project work, you
need to setup your computer to connect with GitHub.
