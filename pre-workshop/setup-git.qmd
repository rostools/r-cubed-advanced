# Setting up Git {#sec-setup-git}

Since Git has already been covered in the previous workshops, we won't
cover *learning it* during this workshop. However, since version control
is a fundamental component of any modern data analysis workflow and
*should be used*, we **will be using it throughout the workshop**. If
you have used or currently use Git and GitHub, you can skip these two
tasks. If you **have not used Git or GitHub**, please do these tasks:

1.  Type in the RStudio Console and follow the instructions:

    ``` {.r filename="Console"}
    # There will be a pop-up to type in your name (first and
    # last), as well as your email
    r3::setup_git_config()
    ```

2.  **Please ONLY read** through the [Version Control
    lesson](https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org/sessions/version-control.html)
    of the introduction workshop, **but DO NOT DO any coding tasks or
    exercises**. You are welcome to do them if it will help you learn or
    understand it better, but it is **NOT** required. For most of the
    workshop, we will be using Git as shown in the [Using Git in
    RStudio](https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org/sessions/version-control.html#using-git-in-rstudio)
    section. During the workshop, we will connect our projects to
    GitHub, which is described below.

Regardless of whether you've done the steps above or not, *everyone*
needs to run:

``` {.r filename="Console"}
r3::check_setup()
```

The output you'll get for success will look something like this:

```
Checking R version:
✔ Your R is at the latest version of {{< meta versions.r >}}
Checking RStudio version:
✔ Your RStudio is at the latest version of {{< meta versions.rstudio >}}
Checking Git config settings:
✔ Your Git configuration is all setup!
  Git now knows that:
  - Your name is 'Luke W. Johnston'
  - Your email is 'lwjohnst@gmail.com'
```

**Eventually you will need to copy and paste the output into one of the
survey questions**.
