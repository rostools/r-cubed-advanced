# Learning design {#sec-learning-design}

This workshop is designed using the science of learning. Learning is
when new content gets incorporated into long-term storage in the brain
in a way that it can be later retrieved. Some of the best ways to enable
learning is to do "active learning" by engaging with the material,
practicing retrieving what was just covered, repeatedly being exposed to
the content, linking the new information with what you already know, and
explaining it to someone else.

We use a variety of activities to target the different "pathways" of
learning. A big part of learning is being engaged in the *process* of
learning, not just learning the content itself. So to help you be
engaged in your own learning, we want to involve you in the reasons
*why* we do the things we do during this workshop.

Throughout the workshop, we use these practices to support learning:

-   We have a clear learning goal with a strong narrative throughout the
    workshop that ties back to that goal. It's much easier to learn when
    you have a better idea of where you are going, where you are at in
    relation to the end goal, and what to expect along the way.

-   The main activities are "code-alongs", where the teacher types on
    the computer and explains what it means while you type along. The
    connection between using the hands and doing something tangible
    helps reinforce learning. It also helps the teachers to go slower
    since we have to both explain and type things out, which helps you
    learn better. The phrase "less is more" applies strongly to
    learning.

-   We include several hands-on exercises that reinforce what was just
    taught through retrieval practice and repetition. It gives you a
    chance to engage with the material and the space to try it out on
    your own, so you start to get a real sense of how to do it yourself.

-   We have discussion activities to encourage linking the new
    information with what you already know and do in your work as well
    as how you can apply it. Since humans are social beings, we also
    tend to learn better when there is some social aspect to it.
    Explaining something to someone else is one of the best ways to
    learn! The quote "while we teach, we learn" from the Roman
    philosopher Seneca is true here.

-   We have minimal to no slides or lectures, as they are forms of
    information sharing with the lowest rates of learning. Instead we
    include reading tasks, so you can go at your pace, re-read things
    you may not understand, and take notes, all of which support
    learning. To help reinforce what you just read, the teacher will
    briefly summarise and emphasise key points after reading tasks, to
    repeat the main points and target another part of the brain (the
    auditory pathway).

-   We include several breaks throughout the workshop to help you
    recharge and refocus. The brain is only able to effectively focus on
    one thing at a time in 30-50 minute blocks of time. That's why we
    mix together code-alongs, exercises, discussions, and reading to
    give your brain some variation. Having an explicit break, even 5
    minutes, is enough for the brain to better process and store what
    was covered.

-   We put all the material online so that it is easy for you to go back
    to after the workshop, which builds the repetition and retrieval
    practice part of learning. Our brains get easily distracted, which
    is completely normal. So if you get distracted during the workshop,
    you can go to the material online to quickly get caught up with
    where we are. We also make sure to follow the material on the
    website closely, so that it is easier for you to follow along.

-   Being in a safe and supportive environment puts the brain into a
    more relaxed state that is optimal for learning. That's why we try
    to explicitly create that space, for example with the use of our
    Code of Conduct.

-   Asking for help can feel difficult, especially when you are learning
    and are unsure about something. To make it easier and feel safer, we
    use origami hats (or stickies) to show how everyone is doing. If you
    need help, you put up the "help" hat (usually orange) and a helper
    will come to you as soon as possible. If not, you can put up a "all
    good" hat (usually blue) to let us know you are following along.
    Since we often have several helpers, you usually won’t wait long.
    This simple system lets you ask for help without interrupting the
    teacher or drawing attention, so you can keep following along while
    you wait. Our goal is to make getting help easier and more
    comfortable.

Now you know a bit more about the thoughts behind how we've designed
this workshop to really try to support and enable your learning! :tada:
