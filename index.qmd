Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly in demand
and needed by scientists and researchers in our modern research
environments. More frequently, our work include a high level
collaboration on scientific projects, and consequently many new
challenges arise that we as researchers do not have the training for nor
knowledge on how to resolve. Challenges include:

-   Establishing common coding styles and standards to make it easier to
    read or review each others code;

-   Documenting the software dependencies of a project in order to
    synchronize computing environments among the collaborators and
    potentially servers;

-   Documenting (and automating) the steps taken to process, analyze,
    and present the data and findings in a way that allows collaborators
    to re-generate the most recent results.

Training and awareness of the skills and knowledge necessary to create
reproducible and transparent data analysis pipelines are still very much
lacking for researchers. Partly due to this gap, how *exactly* an
analysis is done to produce a given result is poorly, if at all,
described in scientific studies. This could have major impact on the
reproducibility an ultimately the reliability of studies.

This course is designed to address these issues in code-along sessions
(instructor and learner coding together), reading activities, some
discussion activities, and exercises using a real-world dataset. This
website contains all of the material for the course, from reading
material to exercises to images. It is structured as a book, with
"chapters" as lessons, given in order of appearance. We make heavy use
of the website throughout the course where code-along sessions follow
the material on the website nearly exactly (with slight modifications
for time or more detailed explanations).

The course material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to
write the lessons and create the book format,
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
repository of the material, and [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to create and host the website. The
original source material for this course is found on the
[`r-cubed-advanced`](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-advanced)
GitHub repository.
