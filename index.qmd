Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly in demand
and needed by scientists and researchers in modern research
environments. More frequently, our work, as researchers, includes a high
level of collaboration on scientific projects. Consequently, many new
challenges arise that we lack the training or knowledge to resolve.

These challenges include:

-   Establishing common coding styles and standards to make it easier to
    read or review each otherâ€™s code;
-   Documenting the software dependencies of a project to synchronize
    computing environments among collaborators and potentially with
    servers;
-   Documenting (and automating) the steps taken to process, analyze,
    and present data and findings in a way that allows collaborators to
    regenerate the most recent results.

Training and awareness of the skills and knowledge necessary to create
reproducible and transparent data analysis pipelines are still
significantly lacking among researchers. Partly due to this gap, how
*exactly* an analysis is done (including data processing and wrangling)
to produce a given result are often poorly, if at all, described in
scientific studies. This can have a major impact on the reproducibility
and, ultimately, the reliability of studies.

This 3-day workshop is designed to address these issues by using
participatory live-typing or "code-alongs", where the teacher
demonstrates the tasks on their computer connected to a projector while
learners type along on their own computer. The workshop also includes
reading tasks, discussion activities, hands-on exercises using a
real-world dataset, and group work on a project to apply the skills
gained from the workshop.

This website contains all of the material for the workshop, including
readings, exercises, presentations, live-typing material, and images. It
is structured as a book, with "chapters" as sessions, in order of
appearance. We make heavy use of the website throughout the workshop
where "type-along" sessions almost identically follow the material on
the website (with slight modifications for time or more detailed
explanations).

Check out the overview section of the workshop, starting with the
[Syllabus](/overview/syllabus.qmd).

If you plan on attending the workshop, please make sure to complete the
[Pre-workshop tasks](/pre-workshop/overview.qmd) to get set up and ready
for the workshop. The pre-workshop tasks include a survey that you need
to fill out before the workshop starts.

## Target audiences

This website and its content are targeted to three groups:

1.  For the **learners** to use during the workshop, both to follow
    along and also to use as a reference after the workshop ends. A more
    detailed description of who the learner is can be found in [Is this
    for you?](/overview/is-this-for-you.qmd)
2.  For the **teachers** to use as a guide for when they do the
    type-along sessions.
3.  For those who are **interested in teaching**, who may not have much
    experience or may not know where to start, to use this website as a
    guide to running and teaching their own workshops.
