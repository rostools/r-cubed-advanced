Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly in demand
and needed by scientists and researchers in our modern research
environments. More frequently, our work include a high level
collaboration on scientific projects, and consequently many new
challenges arise that we as researchers do not have the training for nor
knowledge on how to resolve. Challenges include:

-   Establishing common coding styles and standards to make it easier to
    read or review each others code;

-   Documenting the software dependencies of a project in order to
    synchronize computing environments among the collaborators and
    potentially servers;

-   Documenting (and automating) the steps taken to process, analyze,
    and present the data and findings in a way that allows collaborators
    to re-generate the most recent results.

Training and awareness of the skills and knowledge necessary to create
reproducible and transparent data analysis pipelines are still very much
lacking for researchers. Partly due to this gap, how *exactly* an
analysis is done to produce a given result is poorly, if at all,
described in scientific studies. This could have major impact on the
reproducibility an ultimately the reliablity of studies.

This course is designed to address these issues in code-along sessions
(instructor and learner coding together), reading activities, and
exercises using real-world datasets. This website contains all of the
material for the course, from reading material to exercises to images.
It is structured as a book, with "chapters" as lessons, given in order
of appearance. We make heavy use of the website throughout the course
where code-along sessions follow the material on the website nearly
exactly (with slight modifications for time or more detailed
explanations).

The course material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to
write the lessons and create the book format,
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
repository of the material, and [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to create and host the website. The
original source material for this course is found on the
[`r-cubed-advanced`](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-advanced)
GitHub repository.
