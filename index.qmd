Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly in demand
and needed by scientists and researchers in modern research
environments. More frequently, our work, as researchers, includes a high
level of collaboration on scientific projects. Consequently, many new
challenges arise that we lack the training or knowledge to resolve.

These challenges include:

-   Establishing common coding styles and standards to make it easier to
    read or review each other’s code;
-   Documenting the software dependencies of a project to synchronize
    computing environments among collaborators and potentially with
    servers;
-   Documenting (and automating) the steps taken to process, analyze,
    and present data and findings in a way that allows collaborators to
    regenerate the most recent results.

Training and awareness of the skills and knowledge necessary to create
reproducible and transparent data analysis pipelines are still
significantly lacking among researchers. Partly due to this gap, how
*exactly* an analysis is done (including data processing and
wrangling) to produce a given result are often poorly, if at all,
described in scientific studies. This can have a major impact on the
reproducibility and, ultimately, the reliability of studies.

This workshop is designed to address these issues through code-along
sessions (instructor and learners coding together), reading activities,
discussion activities, and exercises using a real-world dataset. This
website contains all the workshop materials, from reading content to
exercises. It is structured like a book, with "chapters" serving as
lessons presented in order of appearance. We make extensive use of the
website throughout the workshop, with code-along sessions closely
following the website material (with slight modifications for time
constraints or more detailed explanations).

The workshop material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to
write the lessons and create the book format,
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
repository of the material, and [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to create and host the website. The
original source material for this workshop is found on the
[`r-cubed-advanced`](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-advanced)
GitHub repository.
