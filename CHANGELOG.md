# Changelog

Since we follow [Conventional
Commits](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-conventional-commits),
we're able to automatically create a release based on the commit message
by using
[Commitizen](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-semantic-release-with-commitizen).
This means that releases can happen quite often, sometimes several in
a day. It also means any individual release will not have many changes
within it. Below is a list of releases along with what was changed
within it.
