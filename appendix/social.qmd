# Networking and social activities

## Day 1 {#social-day-1 .unnumbered}

After lunch, for **15 minutes** get in your group and go for a walk
outside (if it's nice out). Share and discuss with your group these
questions:

-   Are you happy with the way you currently collaborate with others?
    Does it feel smooth, fun, and efficient? Is there any tension,
    anxiety, or friction? Share some positive or negative experiences
    you have had related to collaboration. It doesn't have to be about
    coding in R or data analysis, it can be collaboration in general.

## Day 2 {#social-day-2 .unnumbered}

After lunch, for **15 minutes** get in your group and talk about these
questions and topics. You can walk outside, find a table and sit down,
or do whatever.

-   Imagine if you had learned efficient and effective coding skills and
    programmatic thinking earlier in your career and were in a research
    culture that encouraged sharing and supporting these skills and
    knowledge. Imagine that also meant you were able to produce better
    research papers more easily and more quickly, so you felt your
    research output was more impactful and acceptable (meaning, you have
    less pressure to publish). Imagine this gave you more time to focus
    on other things, like diving deeper into a particular problem or
    research question. How would you spend your work time? What would
    you focus more?
