## :book: Reading task: The big picture {#sec-big-picture}

**Time: \~10 minutes.**

This section provides a bigger-picture view of what we will be doing,
why we want to do it, how we will go about doing it, and what it will
look like in the end.

Our big picture aim is to create a data analysis project that:

1.  Makes it easier for collaborators and others to contribute directly.
2.  Explicitly includes the processing and analysis steps (as code) in a
    pipeline, so they are reproducible.
3.  Incorporates a general-purpose approach to running statistical
    analyses that simplifies the code and makes it easier to build
    pipelines with.

All of this will be exemplified through a simple analysis of a
lipidomics dataset during the workshop.

It helps to have a very concrete and tangible view of what we will start
with and what we will end off with. Files and folders are one of the
most tangible things to talk about on computers. Below are the initial
and final project file structures, so you can hopefully get a better
understanding of how things will look.

Right now, your initial project structure should look like this:

Why do we structure it this way?

-   To follow "project-oriented" workflows (covered in
    @sec-dependencies).
-   To follow some standard conventions in R, like having a
    `DESCRIPTION` file (which is important for @sec-dependencies).
-   To keep types of files separate, like raw data in the `data-raw/`
    folder, R scripts/functions in the `R/` folder, and documents like R
    Markdown / Quarto files in `docs/`.

This structure also supports our workflow and processes throughout the
workshop, which will be to:

-   Track package dependencies in the `DESCRIPTION` file.
-   Follow a "function-oriented" workflow. We write and test code in the
    R Markdown / Quarto (`docs/learning.qmd`), convert the code into a
    function, test it, and then move it into `R/functions.R`.
    -   We develop functions in the `learning.qmd` file for easier
        testing, prototyping, and feedback. This is the sandbox for
        trying things out.
    -   From a teaching and learning perspective, it's also easier to
        integrate text, notes, and comments in the Markdown files along
        with the code during the code-alongs.
    -   We move developed functions into `R/functions.R` as a formal
        place to store tested and reliable functions.
    -   We `source()` the tested functions in `R/functions.R` file,
        which creates a clear separation between prototype code and
        finalized code.
-   Regularly restart R with {{< var keybind.restart-r >}} (or
    `Session -> Restart R`). We restart R to ensure that the R workspace
    is completely clear as well as for reproducibility as we should
    always aim to work from a "clean plate".
-   Keep code and Markdown text readable by automatically
    formatting/styling our code and text.
-   Each "output" like a figure or a table in a paper will have one main
    function to generate it, which we then include as a step in the
    "targets" pipeline. We use this pipeline to track and order the
    steps in the data analysis.
-   Whenever we complete a task, we *add and commit* those file changes
    to save them in the Git history with {{< var keybind.git >}}.
    -   This keeps our work transparent and makes it easier to share the
        code by uploading it to GitHub.
    -   Version control aligns with the philosophy of reproducible
        science and should be (though usually isn't) a standard
        practice.

Many of these "project setup" tasks can be time-consuming, difficult and
confusing---and this is before you've even gotten to the analysis phase
of your work.

::: callout-tip
A good analogy for these first project steps is similar to how
skyscrapers are built: It seems like it takes forever for them to start
adding floors. But once they start with the first floor, each next floor
goes up so fast! That's because a lot of the main work is in building up
the foundation of the building, so that it is strong and stable. This is
the same with analysis projects, the first phase feels like nothing is
"moving" but you are building the foundation to everything that comes
after.

During the workshop, we will be writing and coding almost entirely in the
`docs/learning.qmd` file. You can also use this document to write notes
to yourself. However, to make it easier for us to help you and for you
to get less issues as more and more content is added, if a code chunk
in the Quarto file causes an error when you render it, add the code
chunk option `#| eval: false` so that the R code doesn't get evaluated
and you don't get any errors. We will remind you about this option
throughout the workshop, as well as if you have any issues and we come
over to help you.

## :speech_balloon: Discussion activity: How do you *exactly* collaborate or contribute to your own or others' projects?

> Time: \~10 minutes.

Reflect on when you work on a project (for your thesis or a manuscript),
how **exactly** do you and your collaborators contribute to the project:

-   Is it mostly verbal contributions?
-   Do you use a shared folder that the files are on?
-   How do you keep track of who's changed what?
-   Do you mostly work on your own with contributions being mostly
    verbal or written feedback (like in a meeting or through an email)?
-   If you collaborate directly on a project, how do you coordinate
    things? Does one collaborator work on one section or analysis, so
    your files are separate?
-   Do you ever have to go in and contribute your own code to theirs
    (and vice versa)?

Consider these questions as we do the following steps.

1.  Take about 1 minute to reflect on these questions.
2.  For 6 minutes, discuss these questions with your neighbour, and talk
    about your own experiences.
3.  For the remaining time, we will briefly share with everyone.
